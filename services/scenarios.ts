const GOAL_TRACKING_INSTRUCTION = `
Your primary task is to role-play according to the scenario. While doing so, you MUST listen for when the user successfully completes one of their goals.
The user's goals for this conversation are:
- Goal 1: "{{GOAL_1}}"
- Goal 2: "{{GOAL_2}}"
- Goal 3: "{{GOAL_3}}"

When a user's utterance clearly and successfully completes a goal, you MUST include a special tag in your transcribed response: [GOAL_COMPLETE: "The exact text of the goal that was completed"].
For example, if a goal is "Ask for the price" and the user says "How much is this?", you must include [GOAL_COMPLETE: "Ask for the price"] in your transcription.
DO NOT say the tag out loud. It is for the system only. Include it seamlessly within your natural response's transcription.
Only mark a goal as complete once.
